# KOReader Patches!!
I make KOReader patches for fun when my sister asks me to. I don't actually use KOReader but I find it a fun challenge to try to make some of the things she asks for. I do however have a KOReader emulator on my computer but that is just for testing purposes. 

My sister told me to posts my patches / changes online for people to see and use so I made this repository. I am fairly new to both KOReader and the `Lua` language, so please feel free to correct me or assist me where I am wrong. If you encounter a bug or an issue please open an issue. but honestly I can't gurantee if I'll fix it. 

Thanks again for checking it out :)
